!Disclaimer! This is just an addon and needs the full install of SpotDL to work 

Table of Contents 

1. Setup and Settings 

First Things 

    The script needs 2 .txt files to work properly 
    The first one contains the directories where your music is stored and should be named dirs.txt.
    The second one contains the links to your personal Spotify Playlists and should be named links.txt.
    Both of these files need to be in the same directory on your PC.
    The script works by line numbers so the link in Line in Line 1 of your Links.txt 
    will be downloaded to the Directory located in Line 1 in your dirs.txt.

    
The Integrated Setup 
    
    The Script has an integrated Setup on First launch select option 2 and you will be granted with a popup to choose the directory that contains your 2 .txt files.
    The chosen Directory will be saved in Dir.txt on your Desktop 
    To change it simply edit the Dir.txt file with the new path or just run the Setup again.
